# Interactive login shell configuration files:

#- ~/.bash_profile
#- ~/.bash_login
#- ~/.profile

# - New terminal windows (inc. new tabs and splits)

# Note - new shells created using e.g. `bash` are interactive non-login sessions
# and inherit the environment of the parent shell

[[ -s ${HOME}/.bashrc ]] && source ${HOME}/.bashrc

# The bash_profile should contain any configuration that you want to add to the
# shell environment to be available to the current shell and all child processes
# This includes:
# - Environment variables ( those that are exported )
# - Functions ( those that are exported )
# The rest ( e.g. aliases ) should live in the .bashrc

# PATH feels like it should be here and not in the exports file

			# 2. If you just "detach" then session and iterm console are destroyed
			#	but the window remains attached to the parent session
